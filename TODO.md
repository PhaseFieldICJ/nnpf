- add resulting images to log ?
- add loaded checkpoints in hyper-parameters.
- adding hyper-parameters of loaded models in main model hyper-parameters?
- CHECK Convolution classes & add `flat_meshgrid`
- launch script from hyper parameters YAML file
- tools to visualize dataset
- model class name and path in hyper-parameters?
- decorator for `forward` method that detect numpy input, disable grad & reshape ?
- diff, `total_variation_norm`, norm in another module?
- consistant way of specifying domain bounds, kernel size, ... in the command-line (e.g. [0,1]x[0,1], 15x15, maybe event [0,1]Â³ or [0,1]^3 ?!)
