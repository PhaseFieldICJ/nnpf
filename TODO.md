- add metric to TensorBoard (to compare hyper parameters sets)
- add resulting images to log ?
- automatic loading of last checkpoint when giving folder instead of file
- add loaded checkpoints in hyper-parameters.
- adding hyper-parameters of loaded models in main model hyper-parameters?
- CHECK Convolution classes & add `flat_meshgrid`
- base Trainer with deterministic switch and logger version
- disable seed when loading checkpoint of seeded model.
- launch script from hyper parameters YAML file
- tools to visualize dataset
